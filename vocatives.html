    <h1>Vocative</h1><br>
    <p>I don't know if there's already something like that, usually people use names</p><br>
    <p>In my case a simple name is unsuitable and I wanted to shorten clarification</p><br>
    <h2>What do I mean by "Vocatives"</h2><br>
    <p>A pair of names (or set of names) similar to pronouns' `subjective/objective`</p><br>
    <p>But I've decided to state vocatives as `direct/non-direct`</p><br>
    <p>So if one has a name then it is `[name]/[name]` as vocatives</p><br>
    <p>If one has two names (example: informal/formal) they can set `Alex/Alexander` (Alex(ander) as an example)</p><br>
    <h2>What does `none/any` mean?</h2><br>
    <p>So basically what it says is that I don't care what others refer to me as (`any`)</p><br>
    <p>But I prefer not being called ANY name when talked to directly (`none`)</p><br>
